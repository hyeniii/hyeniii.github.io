## Introduction to Autoencoders

### Overview
Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, allowing you to leverage large amounts of **unlabeled data**. They work by learning a compressed representation of the input data and then reconstructing it back, minimizing the reconstruction error. Autoencoders can be used as feature extractors, for anomaly detection, and for tasks like filling in missing data.

### Structure
1. **Encoder**: Compresses input data into a lower-dimensional representation.
2. **Decoder**: Reconstructs the original input using the compressed data.

### Why Use Autoencoders?
- **Data Representation**: Encoders learn a more meaningful representation of data, making it easier to identify clusters or patterns.
- **Anomaly Detection**: High reconstruction error indicates anomalies, as the autoencoder struggles to represent unusual data. Identify data points with high loss.
- **Feature Extraction**: Encoded data can serve as features for classifiers, making training more effective.
- **Denoising**: Denoising autoencoders learn to reconstruct clean data from noisy input, allowing them to handle corrupted or missing data.

### Use Cases
1. **Feature Extraction**: Utilize the encoder to transform raw data into lower-dimensional embeddings.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Measure reconstruction error as an anomaly score.
3. **Missing Value Imputation**: Use denoising autoencoders to predict missing values in datasets.

Autoencoders are versatile tools for leveraging the structure in unlabeled data, making them effective for various applications where labeled data is scarce or hard to obtain.
